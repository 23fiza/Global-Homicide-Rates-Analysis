# Global-Homicide-Rates-Analysis
Project Overview
In my latest data analysis project, I delved into global homicide rates using powerful tools such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. This exploration aimed to uncover fascinating insights into global trends, socio-economic factors influencing homicide rates, and regional disparities.

Objectives
Global Trends: Identify and analyze global trends in homicide rates.
Socio-Economic Factors: Understand the socio-economic factors that influence homicide rates.
Regional Disparities: Identify regions with the highest and lowest homicide rates.
Data Set
The dataset includes homicide rates by country, along with additional socio-economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment rates, education levels, and more.

Tools and Libraries
NumPy for numerical computations and data manipulation.
Pandas for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
Matplotlib for data visualization.
Analysis Process
1. Data Cleaning and Transformation
Using Pandas, I performed essential data cleaning steps to ensure accuracy:

Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
Corrected data-type errors.
Removed duplicates.
Transformed and normalized the data for consistent analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
With Pandas and NumPy, I conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis:

Descriptive Statistics: Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, and other statistical measures for homicide rates.
Correlation Analysis: Examined the relationships between homicide rates and socio-economic factors.
Regional Analysis: Compared homicide rates across different regions and continents.
